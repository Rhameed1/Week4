## Flex Pattern
I implemented flex pattern in the **header**, with space in between, amongst them you can navigate to the **About** page. 

## Grid Pattern
On the **Home** page it made sense to have the **signup** section be displayed as a grid. I like this idea becasue I can add more information on the grid. 

## Responsive Behvior
Using the developer tools I was able to make sure that when the site is in a mobile view or collapsed, the information on the header stacks and the grid essentially becomes stack.
